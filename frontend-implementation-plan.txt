Frontend Tags Implementation Plan and Progress Snapshot (as of 2025-08-25):

1. Objective:
   - Extend the todo app frontend so each todo can have multiple tags.
   - Tags are created during todo creation or editing, can be suggested for reuse, and can be shared by multiple todos.

2. Implementation Steps:
   1. Create a reusable React component TagInput.js for managing tags input and suggestions.
   2. Integrate TagInput.js into TodoForm.js for both creation and editing of todos.
   3. Ensure tags are sent as an array of strings in the todo creation/update payload to the backend.
   4. Fetch tag suggestions from the backend endpoint /api/tags?search= and display as user types.
   5. Add UI and logic for adding/removing tags/chips visually in the form.
   6. For todo editing, prepopulate tags field with associated tags if any.
   7. Ensure all other todo form logic still works and is unaffected.

3. Current State:
   - TagInput.js created with chip input, async suggestions, keyboard navigation.
   - TodoForm.js: Updated to use TagInput, added tags state, hooked tags into form POST payload.
   - Backend: Already supports tag creation, deduplication, many-to-many, and async suggestion API.
   - Both create and update (pending) todo flows will use the same TagInput interface.

4. Outstanding or Pending Items:
   - Integrate TagInput.js into TodoUpdate.js for editing.
   - Update TodoList.js to display tags on each todo if relevant.
   - Perform thorough UI/manual testing for the tags feature in various browser/usage scenarios.
   - Add frontend tests for tag entry and suggestions if using Jest/React Testing Library.
   - Solicit user feedback on UX, and iterate if usability or performance needs tuning.

5. Notes:
   - All changes are modular and reusable: future screens can use TagInput.js.
   - If project structure changes, update file paths above.
   - For full context of backend implementation (see backend-implementation-plan.txt if saved).

6. How to resume:
   - Pick up by editing TodoUpdate.js and TodoList.js as needed.
   - Continue manual/automated testing and refinement steps listed under "Outstanding".
