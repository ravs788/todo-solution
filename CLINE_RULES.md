# CLINE Universal Rules

These rules must always be followed by Cline (AI assistant) in all projects where this file is present.  
They are enforced standards for automation, shell execution, documentation, and workflow.

## Rules

1. When running multiple shell/CLI statements, separate them by semicolon (`;`), not double-ampersand (`&&`).
2. Update project documentation whenever code changes are committed to any branch.

_You may extend or revise these rules as your team's workflow evolves._
