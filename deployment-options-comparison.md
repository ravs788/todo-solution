# Full-Stack Web App Hosting Options: Comparison Guide

This document compares leading cloud platforms for deploying a Java Spring Boot backend and React frontend, including their pros, cons, and who they're best for.

---

## 1. **Azure**
- **Backend**: App Service (Java), App Service (Containers)
- **Frontend**: Azure Static Web Apps (best for React), App Service (static or server)
- **Pros**: Enterprise features, integrated CI/CD, scalable, secure, works well for Microsoft stacks
- **Cons**: Portal/UI can be complex for newcomers
- **Best For**: Businesses, .NET/Java shops, production deployments

## 2. **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**
- **Backend**: Elastic Beanstalk, ECS/EKS, EC2, Lambda
- **Frontend**: S3 + CloudFront (static), Amplify (full-stack JAMstack)
- **Pros**: Global reach, very flexible, industry standard for scaling
- **Cons**: May overwhelm beginners, pricing is granular
- **Best For**: Enterprise, apps needing global reliability/scaling

## 3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- **Backend**: App Engine (standard/flexible), Cloud Run (containers), Compute Engine
- **Frontend**: Google Cloud Storage, Firebase Hosting
- **Pros**: Modern tooling, fast, free tier, good for containers
- **Cons**: Java backend setup sometimes less documented than Node/Python
- **Best For**: Modern cloud-native deployments, GCP enthusiasts

## 4. **Heroku**
- **Backend**: Java/Spring Boot support via buildpacks or Docker
- **Frontend**: Static site deploy, or serve via Node buildpack
- **Pros**: Incredibly easy, great for students/devs, automated deploys
- **Cons**: Free tier sleeps, limits on resources, less control for complex setups
- **Best For**: MVPs, prototypes, hackathons, personal projects

## 5. **Render.com**
- **Backend**: Native support for Java, auto-deploy from GitHub
- **Frontend**: Static site hosting with instant HTTPS/CDN
- **Pros**: Modern, easy setup, very attractive for indie devs/small teams, free tier
- **Cons**: Slightly less enterprise-focused, but sufficient for many
- **Best For**: Startups, personal side-projects, demos

## 6. **Netlify/Vercel**
- **Frontend**: Best for React/Vite/Next.js static sites or SSR
- **API/Backend**: Only support serverless functions (Node), Java is not natively supported
- **Pros**: Blazing fast, zero-config for frontend, best DX for JAMstack
- **Cons**: You must host your Java API elsewhere
- **Best For**: Frontend-heavy apps, landing pages, SaaS UIs with external APIs

## 7. **DigitalOcean App Platform / VPS**
- **Backend**: Build & deploy Docker/Java as a managed service or use classic VM
- **Frontend**: Static site hosting or Nginx
- **Pros**: Simpler than AWS, competitive price
- **Cons**: Not as many PaaS integrations as bigger clouds
- **Best For**: Developers wanting more control, affordable hosting
